# AI-enhanced-irrigation-system

This project aims to revolutionize traditional irrigation methods by integrating AI technologies to optimize water usage in agriculture. By leveraging real-time data from IoT sensors, weather forecasts, and soil moisture measurements, our system intelligently adjusts irrigation schedules. This not only conserves water but also enhances crop yield by ensuring plants receive the right amount of water at the right time.
